# 📰 Fake News Headline Generator

A simple Python mini-project that generates **fake news headlines** by randomly combining subjects, actions, and places. This project is useful for beginners to understand **lists, random module usage, loops, and user interaction** in Python.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer**: This project is for **educational purposes only**. The generated headlines are completely fictional and should not be mistaken for real news.

## 🧠 How It Works

* The program stores **subjects**, **actions**, and **places** in separate lists.
* It randomly selects one item from each list using `random.choice()`.
* A fake news headline is created using string formatting.
* The user is asked whether they want to generate another headline.

## 📰 Sample Output

```text
BREAKING NEWS: Scientist confirms major breakthrough in Space Center

Do you want to generate another headline? (yes/no): yes
